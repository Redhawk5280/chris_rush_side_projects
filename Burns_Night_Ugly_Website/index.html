    <h1><strong>Burns Night</strong></h1>
    <h2>Where we read poetry to sheep guts stuffed with shit</h2>
    <h3>What Happens</h3>
    <p>Guests are greeted with bagpipes, and the pipes 
        reappear to greet the guest of honor, the haggis. 
        The host will then address the haggis with Burns’ 
        Address to a Haggis, calling it the “great 
        chieftain o’ the pudding-race”. He will then cut it 
        open from end to end, sprinkle it with whisky as part 
        of a Scottish whisky toast, and serve it with the 
        traditional side dishes of mashed neaps (turnips) and 
        tatties (potatoes).</p>

        <p>Known in medieval Celtic culture as a story 
            teller, verse maker and composer, the word
            ‘Bard’ has become synonymous with the world’s 
            greatest poets. However, few are as celebrated 
            as Scotland’s own ‘National Bard’, Robert Burns, 
            who we pay tribute to on 25 January each year.
        </p>
        <p>So basically it is a day to worship a poet.
